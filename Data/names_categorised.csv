Taking on the mantle of the Mother, Abeloth helped the The Father keep the peace between her warring Son and Daughter for many years. However, fearing her own mortality, the Mother bathed in the Pool of Knowledge and drank from the Font of Power, in hopes of remaining with her immortal family. The result was that she became the dark side entity Abeloth. Working with the insectoid Killik race, the Ones worked together to construct Centerpoint Station, which they used to imprison Abeloth on their planet, surrounding it with a cluster of black holes, later known as the Maw. Following this Abeloth's family relocated to the mysterious planet Mortis, leaving her to her lonely prison. Millennia later, following the actions of the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, the Jedi (led by Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker) launched an attack on Centerpoint and destroyed the ancient space station. This resulted in the eventual destruction of Sinkhole Station, allowing Abeloth to finally leave her prison. Using her dark side powers, Abeloth possessed the charismatic Senator Rokari Kem, whom she used to assume control of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, as well as the Lost Tribe of the Sith (after her murder of Sith Grand Lord Darish Vol).
